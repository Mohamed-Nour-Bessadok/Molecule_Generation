# Scaffold-based Molecule Generation | Python, RDKit, PyTorch, GNNs

## Overview

Just having fun experimenting with 3 different ways to generate molecules from scaffolds and seeing what happens. The project uses:
- **A Transformer model** to generate molecules.
- **GNNs** to handle molecular structures.
- **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** to enforce chemical rules during generation.

## Key Features:
- Play around with **molecular scaffolds** and let the model generate novel molecules.
